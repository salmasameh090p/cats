<h3><font size=10><font color=green>Persian Cats:</h3>
<p><font size=10><font color=green>The Persian cat is a<em>long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle.</em><br>
It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking countries.<br>
 The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Iran (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620.<br> 
Recognized by the cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American breeders after the Second World War<br> 
Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and <em>Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed</em>, while others treat them as separate breeds.<br>
The dignified and docile Persian cat is known for being quiet and sweet<br>
 Although Persians tend to be relaxed and easygoing, they also command an air of royalty.<br>
They may not be quick to hiss or scratch<br>
but that doesn't mean they won't become annoyed when bothered by loud children or pets.<br>
Persian cat's orgin was in persia now known as Iran<br><p>
